# RWAi - Decentralizing Ownership of AI Infrastructure

RWAi is a platform that enables users to access, own, and earn passive income from state-of-the-art AI Rigs running top open-source models. The platform tokenizes real-world AI infrastructure assets, allowing for decentralized ownership and participation in the AI economy.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is structured as a multi-tenant application with subdomain support:

- `app/` - Main Next.js App Router directory
  - `page.tsx` - Marketing site homepage
  - `layout.tsx` - Root layout for the entire application
  - `app/` - App subdomain content
    - `page.tsx` - App dashboard page
    - `models/` - Models section for app subdomain
    - `gpus/` - GPUs section for app subdomain
    - `mcp/` - MCP (Model Control Panel) section
- `components/` - Shared UI components
  - `ui/` - Base UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
  - `marketing/` - Components for the marketing site
  - `app-dashboard/` - Components for the app dashboard
  - `layout/` - Layout components (navbar, footer, etc.)
- `public/` - Static assets
- `src/data/` - JSON data files for models, GPUs, and servers
- `styles/` - Global styles and theme configuration
- `middleware.ts` - Handles subdomain routing

## üé® Styling Approach

The project uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS variables for styling:

1. **Tailwind CSS**: Used for rapid UI development with utility classes
2. **CSS Variables**: Defined in `globals.css` for theming and consistent design tokens
3. **Component Library**: Custom UI components built with Radix UI primitives
4. **Dark/Light Mode**: Implemented using next-themes with system preference detection
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive utilities

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cjohndesign/rwai.git
   cd rwai/marketing-site
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up local environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Configure hosts file for subdomain support:
   
   **On macOS/Linux**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hosts
   ```
   
   **On Windows**:
   ```
   C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
   ```
   
   Add the following line:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 app.localhost
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

6. Open your browser:
   - Marketing site: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - App dashboard: [http://app.localhost:3000](http://app.localhost:3000)

## üåê Subdomain Routing

The project uses Next.js middleware and configuration to handle subdomain routing:

- `middleware.ts`: Detects requests from the `app.` subdomain and handles routing
- `next.config.mjs`: Configures rewrites for subdomain support
- App content is served from the `/app/app` directory when accessing via subdomain

For more details, see [SUBDOMAIN_SETUP.md](SUBDOMAIN_SETUP.md) and [HOSTS_SETUP.md](HOSTS_SETUP.md).

## üöß Current Issues and Improvements

### Known Issues

1. **Dynamic Routing Issues**: 
   - **Problem**: Dynamic routes for model, GPU, and MCP detail pages (e.g., `/models/[modelId]`, `/gpus/[gpuId]`, `/mcp/[serverId]`) are returning 404 errors when accessed through the app subdomain.
   - **Root Cause**: The middleware and Next.js configuration have conflicts in how they handle subdomain routing with dynamic parameters. The middleware is correctly rewriting the URL, but the Next.js router is not properly resolving the dynamic segments.
   - **Current Workarounds**: 
     - Using catch-all routes (`[...slug]`) as a temporary solution
     - Created debug pages to test different routing approaches
     - Implemented API routes to verify data fetching works correctly

2. **API Routes with Subdomains**: 
   - API routes (`/api/models/[modelId]`) work inconsistently when accessed through the app subdomain
   - The middleware matcher configuration needs careful adjustment to include API routes without breaking other functionality

3. **File Structure Confusion**: 
   - The nested structure (`/app/app/models/[modelId]`) creates confusion with the subdomain routing
   - Need clearer separation between subdomain content and path-based routing

4. **Image Optimization**: Some images may not be properly optimized for production

### Suggested Improvements

1. **State Management**: Implement a more robust state management solution (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
2. **Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization
3. **API Integration**: Connect to backend services for real data
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
5. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages
6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
7. **SEO**: Enhance metadata and structured data for better search engine visibility
8. **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility compliance (WCAG)
